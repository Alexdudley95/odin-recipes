  <p>This recipe will teach you how to make <strong>Pasta Bake</strong>, it will take about <strong>45 minutes</strong> to make!</p>
  <p>Pasta bake is a great sharing recipe, it only uses a handful of ingredients and is really easy to make. It's great for when you have guests over or,
    if you want to make enough food for left overs for tomorrows work lunch!
  </p>

  <p>Personally, I recommend buying cheap pasta and cheddar cheese from your local supermarket but going for a brand name sauce like Dolmio.
    Obviously you can buy what ever ingredients you like. You could also add in extra ingredients like chicken or a meat alternative but I won't be covering that in this recipe.

    <li>300g Dry pasta</li>
